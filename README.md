# -AD CAMPAIGN-Project-MYSQL-
Problem Statement - There was a companmy name 'Epic' which used to conduct many competitions on their portal by running an Ad campaign.
The ultimate Goal of the project was to help the company to identify the current duration to run an Ad campaign so that maximum users can be targeted and encourage the inactive users to relogin to the portal and participate in various competition run by them.

Roles and Responsibilty - My roles and responsibilty was to perform data extraction by using MYSQL database and capture key insights of the data which can be beneficail for the company to make data driven decisions.

Steps Followed-

1. Gone through the data which source was MYSQL.
2. Create an ER diagram to identiy the struture of the database like how many columns are there what are the datatypes they hold and the number of primary key and forgein key.
3. Performed data Extraction by using various MYSQL functions like String,Number,Character & date time.
4. Created views and stored procudure whenever required.


Challanges faced - So basically there were 12 columns in my database but only some of them were helpful so here I used to join same tables again again so instead of that I created a view of the table which saved my time and efficieny to rewrite the join sytanx over and over. Also by creating view it helped me query my insight faster .

Result - Increased company efficiency by locating the duration to run an 'Ad campaign'.
